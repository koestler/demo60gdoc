\section{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Importance of mobile communication
\item Need for bigger datarates
\item Need for miniaturization
\item Access to big data storages
\item Video streaming
\end{itemize}

\section{60 GHz}
\begin{itemize}
\item huge bandwidth possible
\item Big delay spread
\item Phase noise
\item Big freespace attenuation
\item Possibility of small antenna arrays with many antennas
\item Almost no interferer at the moment (and later due to high attenuation)
\end{itemize}

In order to analyse the different receiver designs described in
\chapref{chap:rx}, to get measurements about the different channels
and to quantize phase noise figures, a versatile comminication system
including a simulation framework and interfaces to the hardware
was needed. \\
