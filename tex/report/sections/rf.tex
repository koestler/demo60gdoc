\chapter{Receiver Design}
\section{Receiver Architecture}
\subsection{Quadrature Baseband Receiver}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show overview picture of architecture
\item Frequency space pictures of Baseband, TX-IF, 60G, RX-IF, Baseband
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Low IF Sampling Receiver}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show overview picture of architecture
\item Frequency space pictures of Baseband, TX-IF, 60G, RX-IF, Baseband
\item RX and TX-LO offset to make sure LSB part is out of band
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Classical Sub-Nyquist Sampling Receiver}
\subsection{Complex Sub-Nyquist Sampling Receiver}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show overview picture of architecture
\item Motivation: Save external mixer
\item Frequency space pictures of Baseband, TX-IF, 60G, RX-IF, Baseband
\item Sub-nyquist sampling, reference to component restrictions
\item Show how sub-nyquist sampling works with hilbert transform to generate analytical signal
\end{itemize}

\section{Generation of Analytic Signal in analog domain}
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain how perfect analytic signal is created using hilbert transform
\item Explain how it is created using the sin/cos mixer
\item Explain error introduced in non perfect case
\end{itemize}
