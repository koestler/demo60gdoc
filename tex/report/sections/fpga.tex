\chapter{FPGA}
\subsection{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item Block diagram of all modules and clock domains
\item Short discription of the purpose of each module
\item Some words about where more receiver functions can be added
\item Req/Ack-protocoll, everything stallable
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Clock domain planing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reset
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Acquisition}
\begin{itemize}
\item Challenges of high speed data aquisition
\item FMC Plug
\item 4 x 12 bits ddr at 450 MHz
\item IDDR, INFIFO placement
\item Clock distribution
\item difficulties with reset 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Storage}
\begin{itemize}
\item DDR3 and its difficulties (refresh, address scheme etc.)
\item Bandwidth calculcation (mes. numbers of datathroughput)
\item MIG of xilinx and it's userinterface
\item pitfall: Mask-Bits 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Download}
\begin{itemize}
\item considered options: UART, Ethernet, USB2
\item Used USB-PHY and Usb2 Ip Core of xilinx
\item Microblaze software and its features
\item Implemented endpoints and the transfer protocol
\item Linux software for download
\end{itemize}
