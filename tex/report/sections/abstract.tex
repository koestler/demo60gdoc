\chapter*{Abstract}
The \gls{DFT} processor is a key component in
\gls{OFDM} communication systems
and often needs to support different input sample sizes.
To reduce the development effort when experimenting with new mobile standards,
a \gls{FFT} Core Generator was implemented which can generate a \gls{FFT} Core for
a specific application.
Even tough our core generator is focused on \gls{OFDM},
it can also be used for many different applications.
It was designed to achieve a reasonable throughput and latency
on the smallest area possible while being configurable in terms of
\gls{FFT} point sizes and word widths.
