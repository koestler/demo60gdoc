\chapter{Communication and Measurement System}
\label{chap:sys}

In order to analyze the different receiver designs described in
\chapref{chap:rx} and to experiment with different channels
and system parameters, a versatile communication system
including a simulation framework and interfaces to the hardware
were needed. \\

The primary aim of the setup is to show, that multi-gigabit per second
throughput is possible using high modulation and wide channels.
Also the effect of phase noise and other performance limiting impairments
were investigated. \\

To achieve all this goals, a flexible simulation framework based on Matlab
supporting many configurations like different receiver architectures,
configurable \gls{IF} frequencies, different channel estimation algorithms
and modulation schems was ritten. It is able to simulate
the different receivers designs but also interfaces to the hardware
to replace the \gls{RF} parts by real hardware. Matlab was chosen
because of it's widespread use in communication systems research. \\

To optimally contribute to existing work, many parameters, including
the important parts of the frame structure, as well as modulation
schemes, were done according to the proposed \gls{IEEE} 802.11ad standard.
Since this system is solely for research and to avoid spending any
time on unnecessary features, the used system is not compliant to the
proposed standard though. \\

In all our experiments only one sender and one receiver is used.
Therefor there is no need for any frequency and time slot acquisition
method. During each run of the simulation script, exactly one frame
of a fixed size is transmitted and received.
When the hardware is used, the waveform of this frame is loaded into
the \gls{AWG} and retransmitted in an loop.
The acquisition hardware uses a trigger signal generated by the \gls{AWG}
to start acquisition shortly before the frame starts.

\section{Frame structure}
\label{sec:sys_frame_struct}
The basic idea of a frame in a system like the one proposed by
IEEE 802.11ad is to form one chunk of data which is transmitted without
interruption. \\
There is no context, except fixed parameters, stored across consecutive
frames. Therefor all needed parameters for reception like frequency offset,
channel response, phase corrections etc. are estimated on a per frame basis. \\

Most parameters, like frequency offset, channel response, and
synchronization in time can be done only once on the beginning of the
frame using a fixed preamble.
The channel response is than assumed to be constant enough during
the whole frame such that the last data symbol of the frame can still be
sufficiently well recovered by the receiver.
This assumption limits the maximum length a frame can have. \\

The length of the preamble mainly depends on the maximal delay spread%
\footnote{The difference in time of the arrival of the earliest and the
  latest significant energy component divided by the symbol length
  $T_s = \frac{1}{f_s}$} and the precision of the used oscillators defining
the maximal frequency offset. \\

The absolute phase of the first data symbol is detected and corrected by the
channel correction. In our case of a system working on 60 GHz, the
phase is heavily affected by phase noise as it was characterized in
\todo{cite radoslav's work}. This results in consecutive symbols to be
rotated such that less than a few hundred symbols at $f_s = 1.8 \;\text{GHz}$
could be transmitted before the rotation is so severe that detection
becomes impossible. \\

Because only a few hundred data symbols per frame would mean,
that a significant part of transmission time and energy is spent
on the preamble overhead, the data is split into data blocks each having
it's own phase noise estimation and correction. \\

The used frame structure is shown in \figref{fig:sys_frame_struct}.
The \gls{FES} field is described in \secref{sec:sys_fes},
the \gls{CES} field in \secref{sec:sys_ces},
the Data fields in \secref{sec:sys_data} and the
\gls{PES} field in \secref{sec:sys_pes}.

\section{Modulation and Pulse Shaping Scheme}
For the data fields \gls{BPSK}  and arbitrary, even
\gls{QAM} modulations were implemented. Thereby the data rate
can be maximized depending on the \gls{SNR}. \\

Because the training and estimation fields are not used to
transmit any information but only to synchronize in time
and frequency and to measure channel properties, they were all
modulated using \gls{BPSK}. \\

A constant symbol rate $f_s$ was used in for the whole frame. \\

A \gls{RRC} filter was used for pulse shaping. It has the advantage that
the same filter can be used for transmission and reception. \\

\section{Frequency Offset Estimation and Correction}
\label{sec:sys_fes}
The \gls{FES} field is used to do a simple, non standard compliant frequency
offset estimation. It consists of $L$ copies of the same random data block $d$
of length $l$.
The frequency offset is than estimated by calculating the average phase
difference $a$ of each block $k$ with the previous block $k - 1$
\eqref{eq:sys_foffset_a}. The frequency offset estimation
$f_{\text{offset est.}}$ can than be calculated using \eqref{eq:sys_foffset}
where $f_s$ is the sample rate. \\

\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{2}
    a &= \frac{1}{(L-1) \cdot l}
    \sum_{k=1}^{L-1} \sum_{i=0}^{l-1} \overline{d[i][k-1]} \cdot d[i][k]
    \label{eq:sys_foffset_a} \\
    f_{\text{offset est.}} &= \frac{a}{2 \pi} \cdot \frac{f_s}{l}
    \label{eq:sys_foffset}
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}

\section{Time Synchronization \& Channel Estimation and Correction}
\label{sec:sys_ces}
For channel estimation a low complexity channel estimator for long dealy
spreads is used.
The \gls{CES} field consists of Golay complementary sequences which
have very specific autocorrelation properties as described in \cite{golay}. \\

In our case a total of $2 \cdot 512 + 128 = 1152$ symbols plus
a cyclic prefix of $128$ symbols are used resulting in a \gls{CES} field
length of 1280. \\

As described in \secref{sec:sys_frame_struct}, the data blocks form a cyclic
structure by always having a \gls{CES} field before and after the data field.
Therefor the data blocks (data field \& \gls{CES} field) can be transformed
to frequency domain using the \gls{FFT} and back using the \gls{IFFT}. \\

This was used to implement a Zero Forcing Equalizer
\todo{find reference for this. Book?}
by transforming
the estimated channel reponse $h$ and the received symbols $y$
to the frequency domains signals $H$ and $Y$, then correct the channel
by forcing the frequency spectrum to be flat any finally transform
the received symbols back to time domain: \\

\begin{align}
  h \;\;&\laplace\;\; H \\
  y \;\;&\laplace\;\; Y \\
  Y_{\text{corr}} &= Y \cdot \frac{1}{H} \\
  Y_{\text{corr}} \;\;&\Laplace\;\; y_{\text{corr}}
\end{align}

\section{Data Blocks and Data Fields}
\label{sec:sys_data}

As described earlier, the data is split up in multiple data blocks
each having it's own \gls{PES} field following the data block.
Together with the \gls{PES} field at the end of the preamble, this forms
a cyclic structure which allows each data block to be transformed
from time to frequency domain by a \gls{FFT} and back to time domain
by a \gls{IFFT} without any error due to the block boundaries.
This is useful to perform the channel correction in frequency domain. \\

\section{Phase Estimation and Correction}
\label{sec:sys_pes}

The \gls{PES} field at the end of each data block is used to update
the current phase offset estimation which is than used for the correction
of the data block. The field consists of a $l=64$ symbol long Golay
sequence even though the estimation would also work on random data. \\

The phase noise is estimated by comparing the phase of symbols
sent on the beginning of the frame with the symbols sent in
the current block. The block is than corrected by this phase
rotation. \\

The exact algorithm works as follows. For each data block
the following steps are performed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The \gls{PES} field of the current block is corrected
  using the newest $\varphi_{\text{offset est.}}$.
  The correction is a complex multiplication \eqref{eq:sys_pes_p_correct}
  where $p[i]$ are the uncorrected and
  $p_{\text{corr}}[i]$ are the corrected \gls{PES} symbols.
  $\varphi_{\text{offset est.}}$ is zero for the first block.
\item The current \gls{PES} field $p_{\text{corr}}[i]$
  is correlated with the first \gls{PES} field $p_{\text{first}}$
  to get the mean angle $m$ \eqref{eq:sys_pes_angle}.
\item The phase estimation is updated:
  $\varphi_{\text{offset est.}} := \varphi_{\text{offset est.}} + m$
\item The current data block $d$ of length $M$ is corrected using
  \eqref{eq:sys_pes_d_correct} resulting in the corrected
  data symbols $d_{\text{corr}}[i]$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{align}
  p_{\text{corr}}[i] &= p[i] \cdot \exp(-j \cdot \varphi_{\text{offset est.}})
  \;\;\; \forall i \in {0, 1, \dots, l-1}
  \label{eq:sys_pes_p_correct} \\
  m &= \frac{1}{l}
  \sum_{i=0}^{l-1} \angle(p_{\text{corr}}[i] \cdot p_{\text{first}}[i])
  \label{eq:sys_pes_angle} \\
  d_{\text{corr}}[i] &= d[i] \cdot \exp(-j \cdot \varphi_{\text{offset est.}})
  \;\;\; \forall i \in {0, 1, \dots, M-1}
  \label{eq:sys_pes_d_correct}
\end{align}
