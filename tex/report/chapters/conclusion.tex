\section{Outlook}
This research area definitively allows for further research in improving
the full bandwidth transmission system using the result described in 
\chapref{chap:res_1800} as a starting point.

Also the implemented \gls{FPGA} design provides a good platform
for further circuit development. One could immediately start to
move more receiver components, which are currently implemented in Matlab,
to programmable logic since this tricky interfaces to the \gls{ADC}
and the \gls{USB} communication with a host computer are already implemented.




\todo{write Conclusion \& Outlook chapter}

\begin{itemize}
\item Multi GB/s throughput is possible using high \gls{QAM} modulation rates.
\item Phase noise must be considered.
\item Floating point Matlab implementations could be replaced by fixed-point implementations
\item Complete receiver could be implemented in \gls{FPGA}
\end{itemize}
