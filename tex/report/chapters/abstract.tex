\chapter*{Abstract}
During this thesis, a communication system for 60 GHz similar to the one proposed
in the \gls{IEEE} 802.11ad was implemented.
This is done to increase network throughput while
increasing the reusability of bandwidth due to the high spatial selectivity
of the 60 GHz band.
Much research was performed in increasing the throughput of communication systems
by improving spectral efficiency.
This thesis however, shows that multi-gigabit throughput is also possible using
higher, currently unused, frequency bands and high modulation schemes.
Therefor a Matlab simulation framework was written to evaluate different designs
and a \acrshort{FPGA} based evaluation platform was build to perform hardware
measurements.
It was found that hardware impairment correction is crucial for such a system
and that multi-gigabit throughput and high modulation
rates are possible.
