\section{R\&S Vector Network Analyzer ZNB8}
In order to gain a deeper understanding of the non-idealities of the
components which were later used for the different test setups
were characterized using a Rohde \& Schwarz Vector Network Analyzer. \\

Besides the results of the measurements of which a few a presented
in the next few sections, also important lessons about measuring were
learned. It took me about one week to be able to perform meaningful
measurements on the ZNB4 and to understand it's features.
While performing different measurements it soon became very clear then
non optimal torque while connection plugs or overbended cables
can produce notches of dozens of dBs even when using highest quality
equipment. \\

\section{Arbitrary waveform generator: Tektronix AWG 7122C}
\label{sec:comp_awg}

An \acrfull{AWG} was used instead of a real transmitter.
Not only because there is no transmitter available but also because of
it's flexibility. The same Matlab script used for simulations could
also call function output the baseband or the \gls{IF} signal.
The additional marker outputs could be used to trigger the oscilloscope
as well as the data acquisition process on the \gls{FPGA}.

\section{Sivers IMA 58-63 GHz Converter FC1005V/00}
\label{sec:comp_sivers}
The most important is component in the transmission chain is the
up- and down-converter from an \acrfull{IF} to the \acrfull{RF}.
For this purpose the Sivers IMA FC1005V/00 module was used.
It consists of an independent transmit and receive path including
a horn antenna assembly, amplifiers, up-/down-mixers and a \gls{PLL}
for frequency synthesis. It is able up-/down-mix an \gls{IF}
of between 1 and 5 GHz to the \gls{RF} of 58 to 63 GHz. \\

As shown in \figref{fig:sivers} both the transmit and receive path
use two inputs (I- and Q-channel) which are then both mixed to
\gls{RF} and than fed to a $90^\circ$ hybrid coupler. \\
This results in one of the two mirror frequency to be completely canceled
if one channel is shifted by $-90^\circ$ relative to the other.
This can be done by using another $90^\circ$ hybrid coupler working on
\gls{IF} as described in \secref{sec:comp_90deg} or by using die Hilbert
transform as shown in \todo{reference to theory}. \\
The Sivers module is build such that it transmits on the \gls{USBand}
(canceling the \gls{LSBand}) when the Q-channel is connected to the signal
$x(t)$ and the I-channel to $\mathcal{H}\{x(t)\}$.
\todo{describe how receiver has to be connected for LSB and double check it} \\

There are two independent \gls{LO} for transmission and reception both using
the reference. There is an internal 10 MHz reference on the board. During
most measurements the reference was locked to same external reference as the
\gls{AWG} and \gls{ADC} to not have any frequency offsets when different
transmit and receive frequencies were used.

\section{Meca 3 dB Hybrid Coupler 705S-3.000}
\label{sec:comp_90deg}

A Hybrid coupler has typically 4 ports as shown on
\figref{fig:90deg_coupler_symbol}.
One port is often 50 $\Omega$ terminated and therefor might not be connected
to a plug. \\

It is, when neglecting production imperfections, a fully symmetric component
(inputs $x_i(t)$ with outputs $y_i(t)$ as well as indices 1 and 2
can be exchanged) and has the following relations:

\begin{align}
  y_1(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[x_1(t) \angle -\frac{\pi}{2} + x_2(t) \angle -\pi \right] \\
  y_2(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[x_1(t) \angle -\pi + x_2(t) \angle -\frac{\pi}{2} \right]
\end{align}

As shown in \figref{fig:90deg_coupler_measurement} the power of
$x_1$ is not perfect equally split to $y_1$ and $y_2$. The power difference
is smaller than 1 db in the band from 1.8 GHz to 4 GHz.
Also there is a little power ($\leq -20 db$) leaking from $x_1$ to $x_2$ and from
$y_1$ to $y_2$. \\

Due to missing calibration equipment the phase rotation could not be measured.
All measured numbers matched the specifications.

\section{Texas Instruments ADC 12d1800}
\label{sec:comp_adc}
The receiver was build using the Ultra High-Speed ADC12D1800 by Texas Instruments.
It is able to either sample two channels at 1.8 $\text{GS}/\text{s}$ or to interleave
this two channels by applying the same input signal to both channels and sampling
one on the positive and the other one on the negative clock edge resulting in sample
rates of up to 3.6 $\text{GS}/\text{s}$. The vertical resolution of 12 bits is better
than the one of the used oscilloscope (\secref{sec:comp_osci}) and in most scenarios
not the \gls{SNR} limiting factor even when the signal is 6 db below full-scale.
The huge analog bandwidth of about 100 kHz
(limited by the \gls{DC} block described in \secref{sec:comp_dc_block}) to about
2.8 GHz allows to not only sample the first Nyquist-zone but also allows
for sub-sampling which was particular interest. \\

The ADC12D1800 Reference Board was used which has a very well optimized board
layout, supports \gls{SMA} plugs for all important signals, includes a
\gls{FPGA} and \gls{USB} interface for configuration and a power supply.
The reference board has an on-board \gls{PLL} but was often clocked by a marker
output of the \gls{AWG}.
An \gls{FMC} connector exposes the full interface of the \gls{ADC} to
the on board \gls{FPGA} and is used by the Virtex-7 board to capture the data
as described in \chapref{chap:fpga}. \\

\section{R\&S Oscilloscope RTO 1044}
\label{sec:comp_osci}
High frequency measurements were made on a Rohde \& Schwarz Digital
Oscilloscope RTO 1044. With the optional reference input it could be locked
to the \gls{AWG} as well used to have a very precise ($\pm 0.02 \text{ppm}$),
oven controlled 10 MHz reference. \\

During many experiments the real time \gls{FFT} display of the oscilloscope was
proven very useful to check power levels and signal shapes. \\

Since the VISA standard for instrument control is painful to install under
Redhat 6 a small program based on the VXI-11 library written by
Steve D. Sharples \todo{reference: http://optics.eee.nottingham.ac.uk/vxi11/}
was written to convert simple telnet commands send by Matlab
to remote procedure calls. This allowed to setup and readout the oscilloscope
directly in the Matlab simulation framework. This was used to do first experiments
on the actual \gls{RF} hardware before the \gls{FPGA} (\chapref{chap:fpga}) was
completely implemented. \\
