\section{Motivation}
\todo{write motivation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Importance of mobile communication
\item Need for bigger data-rates
\item Need for miniaturization
\item Access to big data storage
\item Video streaming
\end{itemize}

\section{60 GHz}
\todo{write 60 GHz section}

\begin{itemize}
\item huge bandwidth possible
\item Big delay spread
\item Phase noise
\item Big free-space attenuation
\item Possibility of small antenna arrays with many antennas
\item Almost no interferer at the moment (and later due to high attenuation)
\end{itemize}

In order to analyze the different receiver designs described in
\chapref{chap:rx}, to get measurements about the different channels
and to quantify phase noise figures, a versatile communication system
including a simulation framework and interfaces to the hardware
was needed. \\
