%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}
My special thank goes to my supervisors Harald Kr\" oll and Sandro Belfanti for their support.
They helped me finding a very interesting topic, pointed me to the right direction during the
thesis and most importantly helped me when I was stuck.
I would also like to thank Frank G\" urkaynak and Christian Benkeser for the very helpful discussions.
I am very grateful to the IIS at \gls{ETH} Zurich giving me the opportunity to write this thesis and for their IT support.
