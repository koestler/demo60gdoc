\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
My special thank goes to my supervisors Nicholas Preyss for his great support.
He first proposed this very interesting topic, then spent many hours
teaching my everything necessary for this thesis and finally helped me when I was
stuck.
I would also like to thank Prof. Andreas Burg and everybody else of the
\gls{TCL} at \gls{EPFL} for providing the infrastructure, all the interesting
discussions and the very nice time we had during the past six months.
Finally I am very grateful to Dr. Norbert Felber, my supervisor from the
\gls{IIS} at \gls{ETHZ}, and all people in administration involved in making
this exchange possible. \\
