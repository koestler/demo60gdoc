\chapter{Results}
\section{Narrow Band Transmission}
\subsection{Channel impulse response}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show typical channel impulse response of one reflector setup.
\item Show delay spread.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase Noise measurements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Phase-Noise plot measured using many short frames, show that correction algorithm works
\end{itemize}

\subsection{High Modulation Rate}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show that high modulation rates and multi GB/s throughput is possible (\gls{QAM} 256?)
\end{itemize}

\section{Full Bandwidth Transmission}
\subsection{Transmitter Channel Imbalance}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show that transmitter channel imbalance is not an issue
\end{itemize}

\subsection{90deg Coupler Error Measurement and Correction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show error introduced by non-perfect 90 deg coupler.
\item Show the best correction I will come up with
\item Compare to best result achieved by classical architecture (with additional mixer)
\end{itemize}
