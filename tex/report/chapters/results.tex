\chapter{Narrow Band Transmission}
\label{chap:res_450}
First, a system transmitting at only a quarter of the maximal symbol rate
was build and analyzed to show some basic properties of the system and
to show what the best achievable \gls{EVM} values are. \\

As receiver architecture, the Quadrature Intermediate Frequency Sub-Nyquist
Sampling Receiver as described in \secref{sec:rx_2} is used with the difference
that the signal bandwith is only $B = 450 MHz$. All the other properties are listed
in \tblref{tab:res_450}. \\

A block diagram providing an overview of the test setup,
used for all following measurements, can be found in \figref{fig:res_450_bd}. \\

\end{figure}

\subsection{Matlab}
The Matlab script was configured such that it generates the transmitt signal,
programs the \gls{AWG}, reads the data acquired by the \gls{FPGA},
runs the receiver code and finally generets reports and figures. \\

All measurements in this chapter are based on two measurements.
One used \gls{QAM}-4 and the other one \gls{QAM}-256 to
modulate the data. The important properties can be found in
\tblref{tab:res_450_cnf}.
The configuration file used for these tests can be found in
\appref{app:res_450_cnf}. \\

    Narrow Band Transmission Setup (all lengths are in symbols)}
  \label{tab:res_450_cnf}
\end{table}

\subsection{\gls{AWG}}
The \gls{AWG} was configured to output the \gls{TX} \gls{IF} signal $i[k]$,
the sample clock for the \gls{ADC} as well as synchronization pulses to trigger
the \gls{FPGA} and oscillocope. It's configuration and port assignment
are shown in \tblref{tab:res_450_awg}.

It was noticed, that the used \gls{AWG} has some cross talk from
channel 1 marker 1 output to the channel 1 analog output. Therefor the
\gls{ADC} clock should always be output on marker 2 and not on marker 1.
For synchronization pulses, this is not an issue, since they are ware always
configured to give a 100 cycle wide positive pulse $> 100 \text{ns}$ before
the signal starts. \\

\begin{table}[h]

An osilloscope plot (see \secref{sec:comp_osci}) of the generated
\gls{TX} \gls{IF} signal and it's \gls{FFT} can be found in
\figref{fig:res_450_awg_analog}.
The \gls{ADC} clock signal and the sync pulse are shown
in \figref{fig:res_450_awg_digital}. \\

\end{figure}

\subsection{RF parts}
The two analog channels generated by the \gls{AWG} have a total signal
power of -9.28 dBm each \eqref{eq:res_450_awg_pwr}. These signals were
than attenuated by 20 dB to be below the 1 dB output compression point of 10 dBm
of the 60 GHz converters even at full gain of 40 dB. \\

\begin{align}
  10 \cdot \log_{10}\left(
  10^{-25.812 \;\text{dBm} / 10} \cdot
  \frac{450 \;\text{MHz}}{10 \;\text{MHz}}
  \right) \approx -9.28 \;\;\text{dBm}
  \label{eq:res_450_awg_pwr}
\end{align}

The same 60 GHz converter was used for transmission and reception and
configured as shown in \tblref{tab:res_450_sivers} (configuration script
see \appref{app:res_450_cnf}).
A 10 MHz reference clock was fed from the \gls{AWG}.
An aluminium plate in a distance of about 15 cm was used as a reflector. \\

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    Reference Clock & external \\ \hline
    TX Oscillator Frequency & 57.5 GHz (0x038170) \\ \hline
    RX Oscillator Frequency & 58.2 GHz (0x038D60) \\ \hline
    TX Power & 0x80 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Configuration Parameters of 60 GHz Converter}
  \label{tab:res_450_sivers}
\end{table}

Both channels on the \gls{RX} side of the converer first connect to a
\gls{MC} BHP-1000+ high-pass filter. As we can see in \figref{fig:res_450_rx_if},
the \gls{TX} \gls{LO} leackage is attenuated by about 35 dB. Also the \gls{TX}
\gls{LSBand} signal (centered around 3.6 GHz) is about 17 dB weaker than
the desired \gls{TX} \gls{USBand} signal. This is due to the transmitter's
image rejection and the fact that the \gls{LSBand} signal is outside the
\gls{RF} specification of the converter. \\

\begin{figure}[p]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/osci/res_450_rx_if}
  \caption{Received \gls{IF} Signal before (left) and after (right) High-Pass Filter}
  \label{fig:res_450_rx_if}
\end{figure}

Next the signal amplified by 12 dB to drive the \gls{ADC} input to about 70\%
as shown in \figref{fig:res_450_rx_amp}. \\

\begin{figure}[p]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/osci/res_450_rx_amp}
  \caption{Received \gls{IF} Signal before (left) and after (right) the Amplifier}
  \label{fig:res_450_rx_amp}
\end{figure}

Finally the signal is converted to a differential signal using a ADC-WB-BB Balun
(\secref{sec:comp_balun}), passes a \gls{DC} block (\secref{sec:comp_dc_block})
and digitized by the \gls{ADC}. \\

The channel filter shown in \figref{fig:rx_2_bd} is therefor build using
the BHP-1000+ high-pass filter and the \gls{ADC} analog input bandwidth which
cuts of at about 2.8 GHz. \\

\section{Channel Characterization}
\subsection{Channel impulse response}
\label{sec:res_450_h}
First we should have a short look at the channel response of the simple
reflector. The estimated channel response using the Goaly estimator and a
1152 long \gls{CES} field is shown in \figref{fig:res_450_qam4_h}.
As we can see, there is one very distinctive peak confirming one single,
more or less flat, reflector. \\

\begin{figure}[p]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/matlab/res_450_qam4_h}
  \caption{One realization of a Measured Channel Impulse Response in Time Domain
    with Narrow Band \gls{QAM}-4 Transmission Setup}
  \label{fig:res_450_qam4_h}
\end{figure}

\section{Error Vector Magnitude Definitions}
In this report, two different calculation schemes for the \acrfull{EVM}
are used.

\subsubsection{\acrfull{DEVM}}
The \gls{DEVM} uses the classical definition of the \gls{EVM}
and compares the received symbol to the their ideal position.
It is calculated as stated in \eqref{eq:devm} \cite{razavi2011rf}.

\begin{align}
  \text{EVM}_\text{D} &= \frac{1}{P_{\text{avg}}} \cdot \frac{1}{N}
  \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} |i_j - s_j|^2
  \label{eq:devm} \\
  \text{EVM}_\text{D}\text{dB} &= 10 \cdot \log_{10} (\text{EVM}_\text{D})
\end{align}

Where $N$ is the total number of symbols, $s_j$ the complex value of the
received symobol $j$ and $i_j$ the ideal position of the symbol. \\

\subsubsection{\acrfull{REVM}}
During the implementation phase and to show the improvements due to correction
algorithms, a second definition for the \gls{EVM} was used and
is called \gls{DEVM} in this report. This figure of merit is not influenced,
by deterministic errors due to a constant affine transformation of the
received symbols in the complex plane. \\

The proposed \acrfull{REVM} builds one subset of the set of received points for
each available data symbol. The error vector $e_j$ is than calculated as the
difference of the received point and the mean of all received points of that
set. Therefor it does not matter, if all points corresponding to one sent symbol
are off. Instead we have a figure of merit telling, how far one sent symbol gets
spread. \\

To get only one number in the end, the mean value of all the \gls{REVM}
calculated for the different symbols is used. \\

The calculation of the \gls{REVM} should only be used, if enough points
of each data symbols are used to calculate the means values which are then
used to calculate the error vectors $e_j$. This is the case for the \gls{QAM}-4
signal, where we expect $1752 / 2^2 = 438$ points per received symbol and
data block.
It isn't for the \gls{QAM}-256 signal, where we expect $1752 / 2^8 \approx 6.84$
points per received symbol and data block.

\subsubsection{\gls{EVM} per Data Block}
Both \gls{EVM} values can be calculated for the whole frame or for each
data block sperately $\text{EVM}_\text{D,b}$ respectively
$\text{EVM}_\text{R,b}$.

\section{Correction Performance}
Next the the performance of the channel correction and the
phase noise correction will be analyzed. \\

  \caption{Influence of the correction algorithms on the \gls{EVM} values
    of the Narrow Band Transmission System}
  \label{tab:res_450_evm}
\end{table}

\subsection{Uncorrected Signal}
As it was already shown in the last section, the energy of one sent symbol
is spread across multiple recevied symbols. Therefor we excpect a hugh
\gls{ISI} in the uncorrected signal which is shown in
\figref{fig:res_450_cp_rx}. \\

  \caption{One Realization of Data received by the Narrow Band
    Transmission Setup before any Correction}
  \label{fig:res_450_cp_rx}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Frequency Offset Estimation and Correction}
There was no need for any frequency estimation and correction, since all the
oscillators were looked to the same 10 MHz reference clock generated
by the \gls{AWG}. \\

\section{Channel Estimation and Correction}
The result of the the Golay estimator and the channel correction
as described in \secref{sec:sys_ces} are shown in \figref{fig:res_450_cp_corr}.
The different data blocks were colored differentely. \\

As we can see in \figref{fig:res_450_qam4_cp_corr}, the \gls{ISI} is was
corrected nicely but the recevied symbols are still spread on a circle
due to phase noise. \\

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{One Realization of Data received by the Narrow Band
    Transmission Setup after Channel Correction}
  \label{fig:res_450_cp_corr}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Phase Noise Correction}
\label{sec:res_450_phase}
The $\max \text{EVM}_\text{R,b} = 29.70 \;\text{dB}$ value for the
\gls{QAM}-4 case shows, that, when the phase noise can be fully compoensated
for, a value of at least 29.70 dB should be reach for $\text{EVM}_\text{D}$. \\

\figref{fig:res_450_cp_corr_pcorr} show the results, after the phase noise
estimation and correction, as described in \secref{sec:sys_pes}, has been
activated. The phase noise estimations seem to nicely align all received
data blocks.
The $\text{EVM}_\text{D} = -23.88 \;\text{dB} \geq -29.70 \;\text{dB}$ is still
not where it should be though. This is due to the fact, that the whole
picture is slightly rotated. This comes from the fact, that the phase cannot
be assumed to be constant during the transmission of the relatively
long \gls{CES} field (1152 symbols) when transmitting at only 450 MS/s. \\

Therefor, an initial phase correction was implemented by measuring the phase
rotation between the middle of the \gls{CES} field an the first \gls{PES}
field. This was possible by choosing the \gls{PES} field to consist
of exactely these symbols of the \gls{CES} field. \\

The result can be seen in \figref{fig:res_450_cp_corr_pcorr_initial} and the
$\text{EVM}_\text{D} = -30.29 \;\text{dB}$ is finally only 1.32 dB worse than
$\text{EVM}_\text{R} = -31.61 \;\text{dB}$ which shows that the correction
works very well. \\

The phase estimations can also be used to produce a plot showing how the
phase noise affects the absolute phase over time
(see \figref{fig:res_450_qam4_phase_est}). \\

\figref{fig:res_450_qam4_evm} shows nicely, that the \gls{DEVM},
soon gets too high for proper demodulation when no phase noise correction is
applied.
The applied phase noise correction keeps the \gls{DEVM} constant over time
as shown in \figref{fig:res_450_qam4_evm_pcorr_initial} at about 1.32 dB
worse than the \gls{REVM} due to the non perfect initial phase
estimation. \\

\chapter{Full Bandwidth Transmission}
\label{chap:res_1350}

To achieve even higher throughput than those using 450 MS/s with \gls{QAM}-8,
higher symbols rates were analyzed using the exact same hardware as described
in \secref{sec:res_450_setup} and drawn in \figref{fig:res_450_bd}. Only a
few software parameters had to be changed. \\

\subsection{Receiver Image Recjection}
Since this receiver uses quadrature sub-nyquist sampling as described in
\secref{sec:rx_adc_2}, we will first have a look at the \gls{RX} \gls{LSBand}
suppression performance of the current setup. \\

Therefor we will first stick to the parameters used for the narrow band
This results in an \gls{RDR} of -8.16 dB. \\

\subsubsection{Simple Approach}
In order to improve the \gls{RDR}, two correction coefficients, $\alpha$ and
$\beta$ were introduced which are applied on the second \gls{ADC} channel
before combining both channels to one complex signal \eqref{eq:res_1350_a_hat}.
$\alpha$ allows to correct time and $\beta$ phase differences between
the two channels. \\

\begin{align}
  c[k] &= b[k] + j \cdot \hat a[k] \\
  \hat a[k] &= a[k]  \cdot \exp\left(
  \frac{-j}{2 \pi} \cdot \left(\frac{\alpha \cdot k}{N} + \beta\right)
  \right) \;\forall\; k \in \{0, 1, \dots,  N-1\}
  \label{eq:res_1350_a_hat}
\end{align}

Do find the optimal correction coefficients, a coarse sweep was done to approximately
find the correct values followed by a more fine grained sweep over both parameters
which is shown in \figref{fig:res_1350_ab_sweep}.
The absolute minimum is for reach for $\alpha = -0.08$ and $\beta = 0.096$ witn an
a \gls{RDR} of -23.24 dB. \\

\subsubsection{Signal Theory Approach}
\[s_{\text{sig}}[k] = (s[k] + j \mathcal{H}\{s\}[k])/2 \]
\[s_{\text{err}}[k] = (s[k] - j \mathcal{H}\{s\}[k])/2 \]
\[s_{\text{sig, mirr}}[k] = s_{\text{sig}}^*[k]\]
\[c[m] = \sum_k s_{\text{sig, mirr}}[k+m] \cdot s_{\text{Err}}[k] \]
\[C = \frac{\sup_m c[m]}{\sum_k |s_{\text{sig}}[k]|^2}\]
\[s_{\text{corr}}[k] = s[k] - (s^*[k] .* C^*)\]

\subsection{\gls{QAM}-4 Transmission}
To see how well the system performs, when the \gls{RX} \gls{LSBand} overlaps
with the \gls{RX} \gls{USBand}, a higher symbol rate of 1350 MS / s was chosen
as shown in \tblref{tab:res_1350_freq}. The phase noise and initial phase
rotation compensation is done us in the narrow band case. \\
